# Clustering Implementation Using Iris Dataset

## Overview
This project demonstrates clustering techniques using the Iris dataset from the sklearn library. The dataset is preprocessed and analyzed using two popular clustering methods:
KMeans
Hierarchical Clustering. 
Visualizations are provided to interpret the clustering results.

# 1. Loading and Preprocessing
- The Iris dataset is loaded using `sklearn.datasets.load_iris()`.
- The species column is excluded since clustering is an unsupervised learning problem.
- The dataset is normalized using `StandardScaler` to ensure features are on a similar scale, improving clustering accuracy.

# 2. Clustering Algorithm Implementation
# A) KMeans Clustering
# Description 
  - KMeans partitions the dataset into `k` clusters by minimizing the sum of squared distances between data points and their respective cluster centroids.
  - It is efficient for large datasets and assumes clusters are spherical and evenly sized.
# Application 
  - The Iris dataset is clustered into 3 groups, as there are three known species.
  - PCA (Principal Component Analysis) reduces the dataset to 2 dimensions for visualization.
# Output
  - Scatter plot of the clusters is displayed, with each point colored according to its cluster.

# B) Hierarchical Clustering
# Description
  - Hierarchical clustering builds a tree of clusters, either by merging smaller clusters (agglomerative) or splitting larger ones (divisive).
  - Suitable for smaller datasets and visualizing cluster relationships.
# Application
  - Agglomerative clustering is applied using the Ward method.
  - A dendrogram is generated to represent the hierarchical cluster relationships.
  - Cluster labels are assigned based on cutting the dendrogram at a specified threshold.
# Output
  - Dendrogram visualization.
  - Scatter plot of clusters using PCA.
  - 
# Code
The project includes Python code that:
1. Loads and preprocesses the Iris dataset.
2. Implements both KMeans and Hierarchical clustering algorithms.
3. Visualizes the results using PCA-reduced scatter plots and a dendrogram.

# Installation and Requirements
# Dependencies
- Python 3.7+
# Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `sklearn`
  - `scipy`

# Results
- KMeans and Hierarchical clustering provide insights into the natural grouping of the Iris dataset.
- Visualizations (scatter plots and dendrogram) help interpret the clustering process and outcomes.

# Execution
Run the Python script to:
1. Preprocess the Iris dataset.
2. Perform clustering using KMeans and Hierarchical methods.
3. Generate visualizations for interpretation.

## Conclusion
This project highlights the application of clustering algorithms to explore patterns in the Iris dataset. Both KMeans and Hierarchical clustering effectively demonstrate the ability to group data points based on feature similarity.
